# PigmentAI
PigmentAI is a machine learning-based system that predicts optimal paint mixing ratios to match any target color using a fixed set of base pigments. Instead of relying on traditional physics models like Kubelka-Munk, this project uses data-driven learning to map pigment combinations to their resulting colors.
