# PigmentML
PigmentML is a machine learning-based system that predicts optimal paint mixing ratios to match any target color using a fixed set of base pigments. Instead of relying on traditional physics models like Kubelka-Munk, this project uses data-driven learning to map pigment combinations to their resulting colors.



## Phase 1: Creating a Small Real Dataset (Calibration Data)
### Goal: ~50-100 physically mixed and measured data points that are expceptionally accurate. This will teach the system the non-linear behaviour of the specific paint palette
